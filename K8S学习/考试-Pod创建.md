## 原题
```
Create a Pod mc-pod in the mc-namespace namespace with three containers. 
The first container should be named mc-pod-1, run the nginx:1-alpine image, and set an environment variable NODE_NAME to the node name. 
The second container should be named mc-pod-2, run the busybox:1 image, and continuously log the output of the date command to the file /var/log/shared/date.log every second. 
The third container should have the name mc-pod-3, run the image busybox:1, and print the contents of the date.log file generated by the second container to stdout. 
Use a shared, non-persistent volume.
```
